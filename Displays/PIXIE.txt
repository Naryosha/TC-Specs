PIXIE


DCPU-16 Hardware Info:
    Name: PIXIE - Compatible Video Generator
    ID: 0x774df615, version: 0x1802
    Manufacturer: 0x83610EC5 (Agnus Micro Devices)


Description:
    The PIXIE is a 128x96 pixel color display fully compatible with the
    famous Nya Elektriska's LEM1802. PIXIE is a perfect way to upgrade
    your DCPU and start enjoying the latest games and graphics.

    PIXIE has the same interrupt behavior as LEM1802, but it also supports
    a 128x96 resolution graphics mode with 2-16 colors. Graphics mode is
    enabled with a new interrupt that specifies the number of colors.
    If using less then 16 color palette, the lowest colors in LEM1802 text
    mode palette are used.


Interrupt behavior:
    When a HWI is received by the PIXIE, it reads the A register and does one
    of the following actions:

    Interrupts 0 to 5 are compatible with LEM1802.

    0: MEM_MAP_SCREEN
       Reads the B register, and maps the video ram to DCPU-16 ram starting
       at address B. See below for a description of video ram.
       If B is 0, the screen is disconnected.
    1: MEM_MAP_FONT
       Reads the B register, and maps the font ram to DCPU-16 ram starting
       at address B. See below for a description of font ram.
       If B is 0, the default font is used instead.
    2: MEM_MAP_PALETTE
       Reads the B register, and maps the palette ram to DCPU-16 ram starting
       at address B. See below for a description of palette ram.
       If B is 0, the default palette is used instead.
    3: SET_BORDER_COLOR
       Reads the B register, and sets the border color to palette index B&0xF
    4: MEM_DUMP_FONT
       Reads the B register, and writes the default font data to DCPU-16 ram
       starting at address B.
       Halts the DCPU-16 for 256 cycles
    5: MEM_DUMP_PALETTE
       Reads the B register, and writes the default palette data to DCPU-16
       ram starting at address B.       
       Halts the DCPU-16 for 16 cycles

    16: SET_VIDEO_MODE
       Reads the B register, and changes to specified video mode:

          0: Text mode (LEM1802 standard)
          1: Graphics mode, 2 colors
          2: Graphics mode, 4 colors
          3: Graphics mode, 8 colors
          4: Graphics mode, 16 colors

       Graphics mode will use the same video ram starting address as text mode,
       but video ram size and layout are different. Graphics mode will also use
       the same palette as text mode, but only the colors 0-n (depending on the
       color depth) are used. Font ram is not relevant in graphics mode.


Graphics mode video ram:
    a 128 by 96 screen is organized in 1-4 bitplanes of 768 words each.
    Each bitplane consists of 96 rows of 8 words. Number of bitplanes
    depends on the number of colors. 2 color mode has only one bitplane,
    while 16 color mode has four bitplanes.

              memory  total
    bitplane  offset  memory
    --------  ------  ------
       0          0     768   2, 4, 8 and 16 color modes
       1        768    1536   4, 8 and 16 color modes
       2       1536    2304   8 and 16 color modes
       3       2304    3072   16 color mode

    Bitplane number is used as a bit position to refer the color palette.
    The bitplane 0 bit is the least significant bit in LEM palette. 
        e.g. if bitplane 0 is clear, but bitplanes 1-3 are set,
             the palette color would be 0b1110 -> 0xE -> 14

    Graphics are stored to bitplane in a linear fashion; each word of data
    on a line is located at an address that is one greater than the word on
    its left. i.e.  Each line is a "plus one" continuation of the previous
    line.
    
    Following table illustrates the graphics mode video ram if start address 
    is set to 20 with MEM_MAP_SCREEN interrupt.

    The map represents a single bitplane (one bit of color) image at
    word addresses 20 through 787. Each of these addresses accesses
    one word (16 pixels) of a single bitplane. Image with 16 colors
    has four bitplanes like this.


Hardware ID
    PIXIE hardware id is 0x774df615, while LEM1802 hardware id is
    0x734df615. To guarantee full compatibility with all LEM1802
    software, PIXIE has a dip switch located in the control panel.

    Dip switch has two positions that can be used to change the
    PIXIE's hardware id:

        0: 0x734df615 (LEM1802)
        1: 0x774df615 (PIXIE)
    
    This setting changes only the hardware ID. Graphics mode is 
    available in both positions.
